# Week2Assignment-AccessibleImageGallery
An accessible and responsive image gallery.

I found this assignment to be quite challenging, I was unable to get a clear plan for the project, so that took quite some time.
I was unabele to implement responsiveness to the website, I will have to do more work to have better understanding.

I utilized resources from w3school, Mdn and Manny's note to get some work done but I was unable to get all the requirements.

This project however, gave me better understanding of the DOM and how to implement Events, with more practice, I am going to do better.
